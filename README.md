# Applied-Statistics

Welcome to the "ProfileLikelihood" folder! This folder contains R code for various statistical analysis techniques, including Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Log-Likelihood estimation, and Profile Likelihood.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure is as follows:

- `LogLik.R`: This file contains R code for estimating the Log-Likelihood function for `netdata.Rdata`.

- `MLE.R`: This file contains R code for performing Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) on `netdata.Rdata`.

- `ProfileLik.R`: This file contains R code for calculating the Profile Likelihood function and constructing Profile Likelihood intervals.

- `Regression_ANOVA.R`: This file contains R code for performing regression analysis and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance).
